# White Hat Gaming Home Assessment - Alejandro Lora


# Notes about the test
- This project has been created from the recently baked out, Angular 11.
- I have included a ribbon found in a free image repository from Internet. Not the best resource, but I wanted to focus on the completion of the test.
- There are some space for improvements.
- I haven't used NGRX for state management as this is a too small app for that tool I think. I have done a custom implementation of a very basic store with BS, but you can see some principles in there. It wouldn't be hard to convert the state service into a implementation with NGRX.
- I have used Material icons.
- I have used Angular Flex Layout, which I find very convinient to work with for flex and responsiveness, however you might need sometimes more accuracy using media queries.
- I was thinking about using SCSS imports and variables, but since CSS is quite good at it already with Custom Properties, that's been the approach taken.
_ I like the use of barrel strategy and custom alias for absolute paths, but it needs to be used carefully.
- I have added configuration for global imports of SCSS.
- Jackpots get updated after 5 seconds.


That's all. I have enjoyed building out this solution, I hope you find it interesting. Thanks for your time reviewing it.
